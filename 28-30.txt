Chapter 28: Pastries and Pillow Confessions (Or, The Sin of Romance in a Guardian's Gaze)
Breaks are rare for a Type-A like me—post-siege, I'm blueprint-checking till my violet ribbons fray, garden-tending to keep the hanbang flowing, or veil-weaving wards against lingering lashes. But when the steam clears and the tribe scatters (Hans steep-steeping in a corner, Miki amping a newcomer tune), I slip to my lavender chair. Misha's usually hogged it, her Pallas fluff spilling over the arms, but Milo coaxes her out with a mint sprig: "Misha, garden calls—let STAR settle." He tends his herbal plots religiously, paws deep in soil, proverbs humming as he prunes. "Seeds seek their season," he'll say, glancing my way with that zen smile.

I gorge on pastries—flaky hanok mandu or rift-raisin scones—crumbs dusting my fur as I crack open a romance novel. Yeah, those. Steamy tales of forbidden fangs and parallel passions, hidden behind my lounge pillow like a guilty rift. It's a sin, right? In a sanctuary built on Yeshua's covenants, where we shield the lost from Helix's grafts, who has time for swoony escapism? I stuff the pages deeper when footsteps near—Miki's spikes clinking, or Chari's lavender waves swishing. But Yeshua... he knows. He'll pass with that staff-shadow glow (still ethereal post-siege, but closer now), eyes twinkling olive-deep. A knowing nod, a smile that says, "Hearts hide what havens hold." No judgment; just grace. I blush under my streaks, novel vanishing faster than a drone in my veil.

The 360 views help—mists rolling, newcomers arriving (a lost fox-stray today, eyes wide at the lockers). We built this for them, me on details, Yeshua on essence, Milo on earth. But in quiet, sins simmer sweet.

Chapter 29: Chari's Seeds and Ratty Audits (Or, Teaching the Lost to Plant Deeper)
Chari's my little sis—lavender waves and weekend worries, but post-siege, she's blooming like the garden I plotted. While Milo and Yeshua chop and fit the cabin's final curves (those 360 panes now framing foxfire sunsets for Kira, shadowy flights for Lir), Chari's out back, feeding Blanche and Noir. Those white rats are her anchors—tiny spies nibbling crumbs, chittering secrets from the peaks. "Blanche, scout the ants," she'll whisper, then plop cross-legged to count 'em: One by one, like auditing Eternal Paws' lies. "Twenty-seven today—up from siege shadows." It's her ritual, turning anxiety into tallies.

But the seeds? Oh, Chari's a digger. She'll burrow holes willy-nilly in my garden beds—random beans, hanbang scraps, even a pastry wrapper once—hoping they'll sprout into "surprise kin." "What if it grows a treehouse vine?" she'll ask, dirt smudging her waves. Milo hasn't taught her proper yet; he's busy with his herbs, calling Misha from my window nook ("Here, fluffball—mint for your mischief"). But he watches, proverbs poised: "Patience plants the path, not potholes." Yeshua chuckles from the ether, staff tapping soil: "From whims, wonders weave." I blueprint the fixes—trellises to train her chaos—knowing it'll hit with newcomers. A safe haven needs wild roots too.

Hans snarks from his tea perch: "<span class="polyglot">Chan eil e math gu leòr</span>—those holes? Heresy to horticulture." Miki riffs a "Seed Symphony" to cover the digging. Chari's learning; the lost always do here.

Chapter 30: Views from the Velvet Veil (Or, A Break's Glow and the Rift's New Rumblings)
Finally, a true break—post-build, the cabin hums: Lounges filled with dozing strays, kitchen steaming personal feasts (Kira's fiery stews, Lir's nocturnal nibbles), lockers purring with hidden histories. I claim the lavender chair, Misha yielding with a grumpy purr (Milo's call from the garden seals it: "Misha, herbs await!"). Pastries piled—gooey, glorious—I sink in, novel peeking from the pillow. Romance's rush: A heroine veiling her heart like mine. Sinful? Maybe. But in this 360 haven we built—my details, Yeshua's wisdom, Milo's might—sins find space.

Chari's outside, rats fed, ants audited, now burying "proper" seeds under Milo's watchful eye (first lesson: "Depth for dreams"). Yeshua passes, nods knowingly at my pillow—smile eternal. The views? Majestic—peaks to parallels, newcomers nesting safe. We knew it'd draw them: Lost souls, grafted no more.

But as crumbs fall, a rumble: Rift-glass flickers, a lash-echo humming Helix's dirge. "Global Graft... awakens." My veil tightens. Sanctuary stands; but sins—and sieges—stir anew. Journal ends; paws up.
