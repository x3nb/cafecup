                <div class="chapter-content">
                    <p>In Dr. Helix's Parisian lab near Lyon, where French precision twisted into genetic folly, three orphaned chimeras hatched from Eternal Paws' deceptive "adoptions." STAR, the violet-streaked Type-A leader at 28, shielded her siblings with snarky resolve. Milo, 23, mint-green from a Korean rift, pondered in proverbs. Chari, 19, lavender waves and rats Blanche & Noir, whispered doubts. As probes loomed, a bean vial cracked‚Äîescape's first spark. (Full origins: Lab as alchemist's nightmare, siblings bonding in shadows.)</p>

                <summary>Chapter 16: Salvation's Sanctuary (Or, Yeshua's Garden of Second Chances)</summary>
                <div class="chapter-content">
                    <p>The rift's glow faded like a spent bean, depositing the tribe in Seoul's emerald embrace: Mist-shrouded peaks where hanok roofs curved like cat backs, and air hummed with the subtle spice of street-side silkworm snacks. STAR shook violet dust from her fur, her Type-A edge fraying at the seams. "Sanctuary? Looks like a haiku waiting for punctuation." Milo, mint stripe catching the dawn, knelt to touch the soil‚Äîechoing Yeshua's first lesson post-escape: "Earth remembers; build upon it." Chari's rats, Blanche and Noir, scampered to scout wild gingko, while Miki slung her amp over a shoulder, spikes glinting. "Oi, from Paris alleys to Korean clouds‚Äîsalvation's got rhythm."</p>
                    <p>Yeshua: Their parable made flesh, emerging "out of nowhere" in the lab's frenzy years ago. Not lab-born, but a wanderer of worlds‚Äîtall, with eyes deep as ancient wells and a staff carved in olive wood, humming forgotten tongues. As alarms wailed and probes descended, he'd appeared in a swirl of ether, shattering vials with a word: "Enough." Adopting the orphans‚ÄîSTAR, Milo, Chari‚Äîfrom Eternal Paws' clutches (that faux sanctuary where fluffy posters masked the funnel to Helix's horrors), he spirited them to a hidden glen. There, salvation wasn't preached but planted: Cafe rhythms to foster community (STAR's snark tempered by till-tending ethics), gardens to teach resilience (beans as symbols of buried potential), and building to claim agency (Milo's paws learning hammer from hand, crafting treehouses as "homes against the heavens").</p>
                    <p>In Seoul, they paid homage: Milo, channeling his mentor's quiet craftsmanship, directed the outpost's rise‚Äî"Yeshua's Haven," a treehouse-cafe hybrid woven into a sacred cedar. Rammed earth walls rose under his proverbs ("Wood bends, but spirit straightens"), latticed with portal-windows for parallel patrons. STAR curated violet-hued hanbang teas, blending French finesse with Korean calm. Chari, her lavender waves tied back, planted support herbs for her anxieties, rats nibbling roots like tiny gardeners. Miki's riffs filled the air: A new track, "From Paws to Peaks," free on her portal. But as the first foundation stone set, a rift remnant crackled‚Äîa posh British drawl echoing from the underbrush: "This soil? Hardly suitable for bergamot. Release me at once!"</p>
                    <p>Absurdity, like a poorly timed pour, bubbled up. Salvation's garden had an uninvited weed‚Äîand fangs.</p>
