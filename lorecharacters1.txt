hmmm, definitely yes. I'll give you the original names for the characters, we have STAR , star is the first , the eldest but there's one older than her, Miki, Miki didn't come with the three but she arrived later after the cafe was opened. STAR is the shop owner and she runs the business, MIKI does all the finances but she's an edgey punk, musician always on the road otherwise. She loves wearing spikes and always listening to her mp3 player with headphones or earbuds on. I should make sure MIKI has her own page where users can download her free music ;-).  Now STAR, who loves the color violet, is the emo-goth snarky one. Most responsible and a bit on edge sometimes, type A personality and makes sure that the cafe carries the best of tea coffee and everything else, she's the one that the rest of her siblings go to for life advice.  They're all from France , except for Miki she loves the color yellow; and she's British/American. It's a long story but her parents who are now deceased met in London. Then there's Milo, Milo is from France yes, but he arrived  from Korea, and he's a young daoist at the age of 23. He is the third one and has a mint green stripe in his hair, the middle child if you will, he loves his zen garden and speaks in proverbs and poetry and loves Shakespeare. Chari, is the youngest, they all have black hair but her, Chari has white hair with lavender stripes in it, She has huge wavey hair and two white support rats who she carries on her shoulders wherever she goes, her eyes are two colors, indigo and amber, she's an apprentice at the cafe just learning the ropes and her sister STAR is teaching her, right now she's a keyholder and gets to close the cafe on the weekends. Chari has some anxiety and always second guessing herself and quite the introverted one, she speaks but she prefers talking to her rats, that's all for now, let's see what you can take from this and spin those 6-10 chapters! ;-)
