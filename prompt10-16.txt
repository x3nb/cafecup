Create a dynamic, directors cut themed, movie like website with spiderweb navigation system. an emoji spider sits in the top right corner of the website. when clicked the spider shakes and the first thing that it does is activates a drawer that drops down from the top, this is where the menu navigation resides, when spider is clicked again the player drops in place of the navigation, this is where the music tracks are, there are approximately 4 tracks in the playlist that user can see scrolling or light up when that specific song is being played the player has a next function, play, and pause function. when user clicks spider a third time, music player recedes back into it's drawer seamlesslesy as if it isn't there.  More on the navigation menu- only when a navigation link is clicked does the spider ever move, and when the link is clicked the spider spins a web towards the link and web recedes after the link activates. There are 5 links, About, Lore, Movie Time. Characters, Cafe, and Join For Full Access. The website is black background with tiny bubbles. Earlier we created something with cornflower blue Cinzel font that gradates to indigo on a black background. So something similar would be great to use on this website too. Make it Epic as usual to wow my viewers and get then to want to sign up. let's do this!
