ðŸŒ™ Site Structure & Flow (User Journey)
The site follows a gentle, lore-guided path: Awakening â†’ Discovery â†’ Interaction â†’ Eternal Ties. Start simple (index.html), branch to blueprint/realms (explore kin), dive into realms/chats/menu (engage), loop back with nav/donations. Progress unlocks (localStorage 'realmProgress'): Partial (STAR/Milo open post-escape), full (all after interview). Mobile-responsive (grids stack, chats flex), accessible (alt texts, ARIA hints), biblical-infused (scriptures everywhere).
